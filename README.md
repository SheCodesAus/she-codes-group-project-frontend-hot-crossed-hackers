**What was the problem we were actually trying to solve?**

In tech, minorities have so many opportunities, from free conference passes to fully funded degrees. Many of these opportunities are only discovered by chance or through word-of-mouth. **It was our job to create a website that lists and finds scholarship opportunities for "The Ones Left Behind."**

**What is the intended audience for the website we have created?**
 - Our users should be able to engage with the content easily and quickly.
 - Personalized learning opportunities : we want our users to be able to find learning opportunities that meet their individual needs.
 - Users can share additional information about themselves with us to enhance their experience and provide us with analytics to better support them.
